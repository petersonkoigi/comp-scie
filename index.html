Philosophy of the Programme


The philosophy of the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science is to impart and foster
students with the requisite knowledge, skills and attitudes for professional excellence and
Competencies in computer science theories and practice areas through quality teaching,
research and innovation. The dynamic and emerging trends in Information, Communication
and Technologies (ICTs) developments and the appropriation of the same ICTS, provides the
context that continues to inform our teaching and learning.


 Rationale of the Programme
The School of Computing &amp; Informatics, through this curriculum seeks to train computer
scientists who can use the gained knowledge and practical skills to innovate computer based
solutions to the emerging global challenges and opportunities.
Granted that our graduates are, and continue to be players in the global technology and sector
specific industries, this curriculum intends to bridge knowledge and skills gap that will
enhance employability and entrepreneurship, and is therefore informed by stakeholders
feedback analysis, academic benchmarking against IEEE/ACM guidelines for Computer
Science Curriculum development and Commission for University Education (CUE)
guidelines and standards.

Objectives

Facilitate acquisition, adoption and adaptation of Computer Science knowledge, techniques and tools.  Develop graduates with the ability to apply Computer   Science knowledge, skills, techniques and tools to create best-possible solutions to practical problems of varying complexity, in a wide range of contexts.  Develop graduates who are innovative and creative, who possess good problem-solving skills and are capable of life-long learning.  Develop all-rounded graduates with demonstrable ethical and professional behavior, and who possess effective communication, management, entrepreneurial and interpersonal skills.</p>
